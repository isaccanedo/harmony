# Earthdata Login Application Requirement

To use Earthdata Login with a locally running Harmony, you must first [set up a new application](https://wiki.earthdata.nasa.gov/display/EL/How+To+Register+An+Application) in the Earthdata Login UAT environment using the Earthdata Login UI.  This is a four step process:

1. Request and receive permission to be an Application Creator
2. Create a local/dev Harmony Application in the EDL web interface
3. Add the necessary Required Application Group
4. Update .env with credentials

Select "OAuth 2" as the application type. Set the redirect URL to http://localhost:3000/oauth2/redirect for local Harmony. Leave `Required User Information` and `Redirect Time for Earthdata Login Splash page` empty. Check the checkbox for `By checking this box, I confirm that my application is compatible with EDL policy`. Leave the other checkbox unchecked. Then create the new application. After the application is created, you can use the "manage" -> "App Groups" tab to add the "EOSDIS Enterprise" group to the application. This "EOSDIS Enterprise" group will allow CMR searches issued by Harmony to be able to use your Earthdata Login tokens.

If you have an .env file ready to go (see bin/create-dotenv), set `OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `OAUTH_UID` and `OAUTH_PASSWORD` with the information from your Earthdata Login application. If you are not ready to create a .env file, refer back to these values later on when you are ready to populate it.
